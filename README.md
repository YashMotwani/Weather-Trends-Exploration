# Weather Trends Exploration

In this project, I have analyzed **local and global temperature** data and compared the temperature trends of the **nearest city** to where I live, which is **Agra**, to overall **global temperature trends**. The data was collected using **SQL query** on the workspace available online and connected through a remote computer of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). Also, the nearby city has been chosen according to the available nearest city in the database. **This project compares the data from 1865 to 2013.**

**Outline of steps is provided in the analysis report `Project_Report.pdf`**
